## Building the App

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Hedgehog or newer
- JDK 17 or higher
- Android SDK 35

### Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd hojo
```

2. Open the project in Android Studio

3. Ensure Gradle can find your Android SDK. Android Studio usually creates
   `local.properties` automatically. If you build from the command line, create
   `local.properties` in the repository root:
```properties
sdk.dir=C:\\Users\\YOUR_USER\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk
```

4. Sync Gradle dependencies

5. Build the project:
```bash
./gradlew build
```

6. Run on device/emulator:
```bash
./gradlew installDebug
```

### Release Build
```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The release APK will be generated at `app/build/outputs/apk/release/`
